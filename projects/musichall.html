      <div class="section-text" id="fields">
        <p>The space around you is here transformed into a music instrument,
          and as you pass through the gallery space your movement will produce
          notes from the Chinese pentatonic scale. The music of your body is
          played out from the copper cone which floats upon your head.
          MusicHall was conceived by the artist and poet <a href="http://www.alexcecchetti.com/">
          Alex Cecchetti</a> and exhibited as a part of At The Gates of the Music Palace
          exibhition in
          <a href="http://www.spikeisland.org.uk/events/exhibitions/alex-cecchetti-solo-exhibition/">
          Spike Island</a> Gallery, Bristol (UK) from May 5th to July 8th 2018,
          and in <a href="https://www.derryvoid.com/exhibitions/alex-cecchetti.php">
          VOID Gallery</a>, Derry (Northern Ireland) from Aug 4th to Sept 22nd 2018.
          We took care of the interaction design process and the whole technical
          project and realization.
